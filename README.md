## Dictionary [If I get more than 5 star, I will write complete documentation for it]
A dictionary having features like pronunciation, mnemonics to learn words and translation into native Indian regional languages.<br>


It is a destop app having all the words that are asked in any competitive exams.It a total offline working dictionary.<br>

It scraps content from a dictionary website and gets the hindi translation from some other website.<br>

I have not added the database file. I have used SQLite to create database.
You can create your own database file by uncommenting the scrapPages() method under the __init__ method of class Dictionary in file execute.py.

DocString has been written and comments are given where necessary.
